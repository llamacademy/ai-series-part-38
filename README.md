# Navmesh AI Tutorial 38 - Companion AI

Learn how to create your very own Companion AI! In this tutorial video you will learn how to create a companion that follows the player when the player moves, rotates around the player when idle, and attacks nearby Attackable GameObjects when they come within range!

A very common mechanic in video games is to have AI that follows around the player. Some, like we're implementing today, are relatively simplistic and simply follow the player, maybe attack things, and provide guidance and a sounding board for the player throughout the game. Some are more complex with their own complex behavior trees to manage commands issued to them and responding to complex scenarios.
